A simple Python program that converts temperatures between:

-Celsius (C)
-Fahrenheit (F)
-Kelvin (K)

This program runs in a continuous loop, allowing users to perform multiple conversions until they manually stop it.

The program displays conversion options:

1. Enter C for Celsius
2. Enter F for Fahrenheit
3. Enter K for Kelvin


The user enters:
-The unit to convert from
-The unit to convert to
-The temperature value

The program calculates and prints the converted temperature.
The loop continues until the program is manually stopped (Ctrl + C).
